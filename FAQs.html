    <h2 class="font-bold text-2xl text-left m-6">What Type of Shoes Do I Need?</h2>
</div>
<div>
    <p class="text-left m-6">Lightweight - Also known as racing flats, or cross country spikes, these are ideal for speed workouts, like sprints, intervals, and competition.
        Lightweight shoes are built with less foam and cushioning features under the foot, allowing for more natural and dynamic motion for the feet.
        But there is a downside to the lightweight shoe. In general, these do not offer the same degrees of cushioning and shock absorption as regular road shoes classified in the neutral or stability categories. That’s why they should not be used for general training.

        Trail Runners - Trail runners have to maneuver across mud, dirt, rocks and other off-road obstacles, therefore, they require the best in support, stability, and protection. Think of trail shoes as a mix of running sneakers and hiking shoes.
        Not only that, these also provide superior grip for better traction and control on softer, often uneven, and slippery surfaces—typically achieved through aggressive soles and stickier rubbers.

<div>
    <p class="text-left m-6">
        Cushioned - In general, cushioned shoes are made with extra cushioning for a plush feel, but without a lot of corrective or supportive elements.
        Most cushioned shoes are built with shock dispersion features in the outsole and/or midsole portion of the footwear—typically in the heel or forefoot regions.
        Cushioned shoes are typically recommended for runners with little to no pronation as they offer both shock absorption and protection with little to no extra support throughout the gait cycle.
